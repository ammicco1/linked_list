Here's a simple implementation of a linked list in C. 
The list contains: 
 - An element, that contains a key (int value)
 - A pointer to the next node

The functions are:
 - Initialize
 - Add node at beginning, at the and or in a specific index
 - Delete first node, last node or specific node
 - Check if the list includes a key
 - Get the size of the list
 - Get a node
 - Print the list

The list_main program is usefull to the the functionality of the data structure.  

Use 
```bash 
 make 
``` 
to compile, and
```bash
 ./list_main
```
to run.
