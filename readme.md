HERE'S AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A LINKED LIST. 
THE LIST CONTAINS: 
 - AN ELEMENT THAT CONTAINS A KEY (IN THIS CASE AN INT), AND CAN CONTAINS OTHER INFORMATION.
 - A POINTER TO THE NEXT NODE 

THE LIST HAS THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTION LIKE:
 - INZIALIZE LIST
 - ADD A NEW NODE
 - DELETE NODE
 - INCLUDE AN ELEMENT
 - SWAP TWO NODES
 - COUNT THE NODES
 - PRINT ALL THE LIST
 - GET NODE BY INDEX
 - GET MAX AND MIN KEY IN THE LIST
 - QUICKSORT ALGORITHM

 WITH THE LIST_MAIN TEST PROGRAM YOU CAN TEST ALL THE FUNCTION AND AFTER THAT YOU CAN MODIFY THE CODE OF KEY, ELEMENT AND LINKED_LIST TO CREATE THE LIST THAT YOU WILL SERVE
